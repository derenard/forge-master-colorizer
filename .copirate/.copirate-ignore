# Copirate Workspace Ignore Patterns
#
# This file works alongside your existing .gitignore to exclude additional files
# from Copirate workspace analysis while keeping them in your repository.
#
# SYNTAX: Uses gitignore-style patterns (same rules as .gitignore)
# - Patterns are relative to workspace root unless they start with /
# - Use * for wildcards, ** for recursive directory matching
# - Use ! to negate/include files that would otherwise be ignored
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Empty lines are ignored
#
# PRECEDENCE: .gitignore rules are checked first, then .copirate-ignore
# Files ignored by .gitignore are automatically excluded from analysis
#
# USE CASES:
# - Third-party libraries that should stay in repo but not be analyzed
# - Minified/compiled files that don't need code intelligence
# - Large vendor directories that would slow down analysis
# - Legacy code sections that shouldn't influence new development patterns
#
# EXAMPLES:

# Third-party JavaScript libraries (keep in repo, exclude from analysis)
/js/jquery*
/js/bootstrap*
/js/vendor/
/assets/lib/
/lib/
node_modules/

# Minified files (typically generated, not useful for analysis)
*.min.js
*.min.css

# Build artifacts (usually covered by .gitignore, but explicit here)
/dist/
/build/
/target/

# ColdFusion specific directories
/CFIDE/
/WEB-INF/

# CSS frameworks and vendor files
/css/vendor/
/css/bootstrap*
/css/foundation*

# Common vendor directories
/bower_components/
/packages/

# Temporary and cache files
*.tmp
*.cache
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# NEGATION EXAMPLES (include files that would otherwise be ignored):
# !important-vendor-lib.js
# !custom-bootstrap-overrides.css

# DIRECTORY-SPECIFIC IGNORES (only applies to directories):
# legacy-code/
# old-modules/
